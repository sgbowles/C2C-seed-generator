# C2C-seed-generator

**This is refering to seeds as in the tournament bracket**

A random seed generator I threw together for a team name competition for my fantasy league(s). This program was not heavily tested and will possibly fail for .txt files not formatted like the teamnames.txt file in the repo.

Feel free to use for any seed generation. Just follow the directions in the .pdf file.
